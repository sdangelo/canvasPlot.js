# canvasPlot.js
Minimal HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript 2D data plotting library.

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys, just take a look at the example files:
* plot.html - basic data plotting;
* gridAutoLinear.html - automatic grid for linear maps;
* gridAutoSemiLogX.html - automatic grid for semilogx maps;
* resample.html - linear resample;
* spectrum.html - spectrum analyzer:
* scope.html - oscilloscope.

The experimental folder contains stuff that I just didn't want to throw away.

## TODO

* grid ticks, axis labels, etc.;
* higher-order interpolators and resamplers;
* idiotic APIs for the laziest;
* serious API review;
* serious documentation;
* the HTML/CSS is probably somewhat broken;
* minified version;
* releases/stable APIs?
* Node.js package?
* split scope/spectrum analyser in a separate project?
* time persistence of scope signals?
* analysis of continuous audio streams (ScriptProcessorNode, AudioWorker,
  Transferable Objects, etc.)?
* measuring?
* different line drawers (points, areas, etc.)?
* 3D (WebGL)?
* optimizations?
