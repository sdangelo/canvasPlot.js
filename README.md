# canvasPlot.js
Minimal HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript data plotting library.

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys, just take a look at the example files:
* plot.html - basic data plotting;
* gridAutoLinear.html - automatic grid for linear maps;
* gridAutoSemiLogX.html - automatic grid for semilogx maps;
* resample.html - linear resample;
* spectrum.html - spectrum analyzer:
* scope.html - oscilloscope.

The experimental folder contains stuff that I just didn't want to throw away.
